# Movie Store Backend Implementation
This project is used to implement the backend code for one of my UI applications [Movie-store](https://github.com/tharun-coder1/Movie-store)

## Technologies used
* [Java](https://dev.java/) is a popular programming language.Java is used to develop mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps, games and much more.
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".
* [Spring Data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data) mission is to provide a familiar and consistent, Spring-based programming model for data access while still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store.

## Setup

* Download the repository,import it into your IDE (Eclipse or STS)
* It will automatically load the required libraries based on the POM file. If its not loading the libs, right click on the project and run "Maven Build"
* Now once again right click on the project and select option "run as spring boot app", you can see the strating of application
